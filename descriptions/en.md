# SlashBot

SlashBot is a new innovative bot that brings slash commands and other new interactions to your server.
You can get started by inviting and typing out / and selecting the available commands.
SlashBot offers a wide variety of features. From simple moderation over fun commands to utility commands, role management commands, info commands and more.

## ButtonRoles

One of our key features are ButtonRoles.
With ButtonRoles you can easily let members of your server assign role(s) to them selves.

ButtonRoles have 3 modes:
- Toggle, which removes if you have the role and adds if you don't have the role
- Add, which only adds the role no matter if you have it already
- Remove, which only removes the role no matter if you don't have it
