## FAQs

### I want to translate the bot to a different language

Sure you can! Follow the following steps to translate the bot:

1. Make sure there isn't a pull request for the language. If there is, you can verify the translator's work or collaborate together.
2. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/SlashBotDiscord/i18n/fork).
3. Rename this file `/localizations/en.json` to `/localizations/language_key.json`. Replace `language_key` with the locale you wish to support. It must be [supported by Discord](https://discord.com/developers/docs/dispatch/field-values#predefined-field-values-accepted-locales).
4. Translate the `/localizations/language_key.json` file. In case a translation contains double quotes, escape them with a backslash (i.e. `"` => `\"`). Do not change the JSON keys or argument variables such as `{0}`. Unicode characters are supported.
5. Create a pull request for the new language.
6. Wait for approval.
